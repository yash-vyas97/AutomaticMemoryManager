#readme file 

Hello, hope you are doing well. My makefile works perfectly.

I have already set up the directories for the makefile to work successfully, however, I am still information on how it works below.

My Makefile works as follows:

Under the GarbageCollection directory, there need to be 4 files

1. Makefile  2. include  3. source  4. object

The Makefile is the actual makefile I submitted, not a directory, but the makefile itself.

The other three must be named exactly as shown above and are directories.

In the include directory, the files Object.h and ObjectManager.h need to be stored

In the source directory, the files ObjectManager.c , main.c and all the other main.c files need to be stored.

The object directory needs to be empty

Type in make and the programme will produce executable files in the object directory.

Thank you and have a great day.
