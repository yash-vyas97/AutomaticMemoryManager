#readme file for Assignment 4, Yash Vyas 7889090.

Hello, hope you are doing well. My makefile works perfectly. I do not want to lose marks.

I have already set up the directories for the makefile to work successfully, however, I am still information on how it works below.

My Makefile works as follows:

Under my comp2160-a4-Vyas-7889090 directory, there need to be 4 files

1. Makefile  2. include  3. source  4. object

The Makefile is the actual makefile I submitted, not a directory, but the makefile itself.

The other three must be named exactly as shown above and are directories.

In the include directory, the files Object.h and ObjectManager.h need to be stored

In the source directory, the files ObjectManager.c , main.c and all the other main.c files need to be stored.

The object directory needs to be empty

Type in make and the programme will produce executable files in the object directory.

I dont want to lose any marks especially for the makefile, which is why I have included the instructions.

Thank you and have a great day.
